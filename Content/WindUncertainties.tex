Analyse the potential of CHP's to correct uncertainties in an electricity market. Uncertainty of wind turbines has a cost. The goal consists of three parts. Firstly determine the cost of uncertainty. Secondly verify how much CHP's, batteries, heat pumps and combinations can reduce this cost. Finally, calculate from this the maximal investment cost for per unit. In this case we can draw conclusions about how cheap the technology has to become. Cheap enough to become interesting to invest in compensating units as alternative to paying the imbalance prices.

There are various technologies used for CHP's and the focus is on residential fuel cell CHP's. Firstly because the technology is currently too expensive and it will be interesting to see how much it still has to evolve to become competitive. Secondly this technology promises high (part load) efficiencies, which is excellent for imbalance reduction and their future application in residential buildings.

In the past, already some papers referred to this. Two studies for Denmark assessed the value for adding more wind power to the Danish grid in order to reduce CO2. Because Denmark already has 50\% large scale CHP's (District heating), both studies concluded that the wind energy would not reduce CO2 and that only the small scale use of CHP's and heat pumps would effectively reduce overproduction \cite{Lund2005,Lund2003}.
