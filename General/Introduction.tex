Only a few papers can be found about controlling the uncertainty of CHP's. There is [ J. K. Kok, C. J. Warmer
, and I. G. Kamphuis, "PowerMatcher:
Multiagent Control in the Electricity Infrastructure," in
Proc. Fourth
International Joint Conference on Autonomous Agents \& Multi-Agent
Systems, AAMAS'05
, Utrecht, the Netherlands, 2005.
AND G. J. Schaeffer and H. Akkermans, "CRISP: Distributed Intelligence in
Critical Infrastructures for
Sustainable Power - D5
.3 Final Summary
Report", ENK5-CT-2002-00673, July 10, 2006. ]; \cite{Houwing2009}. The first one doesn't quantify the costs, the second and the third quantify the costs, but they remain in the cost sector. None of the papers regarding this subject ever make clear whether it would be interesting to invest in CHP's or not. For this reason, this thesis tries to address this issue by delivering an easy price/kW before under which the CHP price would have to go before it would be interesting to invest instead of paying the imbalance prices.

On the other hand there are also papers concerning the HP applications \cite{Meibom2007}.

None are on the combination (too expensive?)

On wind energy error costs \cite{Fabbri2005}.
