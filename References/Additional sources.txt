Wind turbines and heat pumps - balancing wind power fluctuations
using flexible demand
Balancing wind power
with virtual power plants of micro-CHPs
* Uncertainty regulating with heat pumps

Flexible cooling demand in virtual power plants
* Opposite of generating heat and store it in a storage

Uncertainties in
the design and operation of distributed energy resources: The case of micro-CHP
systems
* Dynamic behaviour of Stirling engine

Thermal gradient niet te verwaarlozen!!
